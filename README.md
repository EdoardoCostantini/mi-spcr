# MI-SPCR

Here I describe the content of this repository and how to replicate the simulation study.

# How to replicate results

To replicate the study, you first need to make sure you have installed all the packages used.
You can use the `./input/prep_machine.R` script to install them.
In the following guide, it is assumed that the machine on which the simulation is run already has all packages installed.

## Running the simulation on Lisa

Lisa Cluster is a cluster computer system managed by SURFsara, a cooperative association of Dutch educational and
research institutions.
Researchers at most Dutch universities can request access to this cluster computer.

COMING SOON

## Running the simulation on a PC / Mac

You can also replicate the simulation on a personal computer by following these steps:
